## The Macrophage Landscape Across the Lifespan of a Human Cardiac Allograft

Pediatric heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for children with end-stage heart failure. Because of its lifelong impact on children, achieving the best long-term outcomes for quantity and adequate quality of life are crucial goals for this patient population. Allograft rejection remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatric heart transplant patients. In addition, these patients have a high propensity for graft failure and poor long-term outcomes. Much of our knowledge of organ rejection after transplantation is derived from rodent models. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the inflammatory myocardial microenvironment in human pediatric cardiac allografts at different stages post-transplantation. We distinguished donor from recipient-derived cells using naturally occurring genetic variants embedded in snRNA-seq data. Donor-derived tissue resident macrophages, which accompany the allograft into the recipient, are lost over time post-transplantation. In contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages from the recipient, populate the heart within days post-transplantation and form two macrophage populations, recipient MP1 and recipient MP2. Recipient MP2s have cell signatures similar to donor-derived resident macrophages, however, they lack signatures of pro-reparative phagocytic activity typical of donor-derived resident macrophages and instead express profibrotic genes. In contrast, recipient MP1s express genes consistent with hallmarks of cellular rejection. Our data suggest that recipient MP1s activate a subset of natural killer (NK) cells, turning them into a cytotoxic cell population via feed forward signaling between recipient MP1s and NKs. Our findings reveal an imbalance of donor-derived and recipient-derived macrophages in the pediatric cardiac allograft which contributes to allograft failure. 


The computational framework includes: 

1) Initial processing of sequencing data and QC.

2) Integration of transplanted heart data with control, cell identity annotationa and visulization.

3) Exploration and investigation of functional differences in gene expression and cell-state shift that may have pathological implications.
